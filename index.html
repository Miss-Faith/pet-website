     <p>This is <strong>Sache. A lovely maltese pup</strong></p>

     <p>Sache loves a lot of things but at the <em>top of his list</em> are the items below:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Playing</li>
       <li>Gnawing on bones</li>
       <li>Going for walks and drives</li>
     </ul>
     <p>His face when he gets into <em>mischief</em></p>
     <img src="images/Pet3.jpg" alt="Photo of Sache">
     <p>There are a few things Sache doesn't like</p>
     <ol>
       <li>People picking him up</li>
       <li>Being left home alone</li>
     </ol>
     <p>He'll probably give you this face when he doesn't like something</p>
